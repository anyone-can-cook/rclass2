# Course description

This course is the second in a sequence designed for students who never thought they would become "coders" or "programmers" (the first course in the sequence is [EDUC 263: Introduction to Programming and Data Management Using R](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1/)).

The course is organized around fundamental programming skills, including the following: using Git and GitHub for collaboration and version control; iteration; writing functions; regular expressions; using application programming interfaces (APIs) to acquire data. These general programming skills are prerequisite for flashier data science applications (e.g., web-scraping, streaming social media data, interactive maps, machine learning).

During class, lecture will give students a conceptual understanding of programming concepts
(e.g., using regular expressions to manipulate string data). Earlier in the quarter, each class will be more lecture intensive in order to cover ground on initial topics. Starting around week 4 or 5, we will aim for a balance where not more than the first two hours of class is devoted to lecture and the remaining class time is devoted to students applying these programming concepts to challenging, practical problem sets (e.g., stream Tweets using Twitter API and use regular expressions to analyze text patterns in Tweets). Students will work on these problem sets in small groups during class and submit them prior to the next class. Although this uses the programming language R, these skills will translate to other object oriented programming languages (e.g., Python).

## Prerequisite Requirements 

The prerequisite is the first course in the sequence: [EDUC 263: Introduction to Programming and Data Management Using R](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1/).

## Course structure

For the first two weeks of the course, we will have synchronous lectures and class time will be on TBD. In the subsequent weeks, we will have asynchronous (pre-class) lectures and a synchronous workshop-style class that meets on TBD. Weekly homework will consist of students working through the lectures on their own, a modest amount of required reading, and weekly problem sets completed in groups of three.

1. __Asynchronous (pre-class) lectures__. Weekly asynchronous lectures will be posted on the course website with the expectation that students work through the lecture in advance of our weekly synchronous class meeting. Lecture materials will consist of three types of resources: first, detailed lecture notes (HTML) with sample code; second, short videos (e.g., 15 to 30 total minutes per week) that provide a high-level discussion of important and/or challenging concepts from the lecture slides, but not a line-by-line recitation of the lecture; and, third, the .Rmd file that created the HTML lecture notes. This .Rmd file will contain all "code chunks" and links to all data utilized in the lecture. Thus, students will be able to "learn by doing" in that they can run R code on their own computer while they work through lecture materials on their own.
1. __Synchronous workshop-style class meetings.__ We will have one synchronous class meeting per week. Typically, these meetings will begin with a discussion of concepts students found difficult or confusing from the lecture materials. The bulk of class time will be devoted to students working in groups on a substantive activity posed by the instructor. While students work in groups, the instructor and teaching assistants will visit each group to answer questions and talk through ideas. We will not be recording these synchronous sessions to respect student privacy.

# Classroom environment

We all have a responsibility to ensure that every member of the class feels valued and safe. 
Be mindful that our words and body language affects others in ways we might not fully understand. We have a responsibility to express our ideas in a way that doesn't make disparaging generalizations and doesn't make people feel excluded. As an instructor, I am responsible for setting an example through my own conduct.

Learning the fundamentals of a new programming language can feel overwhelming! We must create an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and talking about what they did not understand. Discomfort is part of the learning process. Unburden yourself from the weight of being an "expert." Focus your energy on improving and helping your classmates improve.

##  Towards an anti-racist, anti-heteronormative learning experience

This course teaches R programming and working with data, tools that are often perceived as objective, independent of context and content. We must acknowledge that racism, white supremacy, and heteronormative ideas of gender identity and sexual orientation are rooted in every aspect of data. These seemingly objective rules (e.g., "the right way to handle data") affect the way data are gathered, how variables are created, the questions asked (or not asked), etc. 

In this course we will utilize data that reflect systemic gaps based on race, ethnicity, immigration status, and gender identity, among other aspects of identity. It is critical to acknowledge that the processes used to create these data (e.g., how data collected, the categories chosen to represent identity) are often based on notions of white supremacy and heteronormativity. When you encounter a data management strategy that may cause harm, we encourage you to raise concerns. It may be that your instructor/TAs may need to think more critically about strategies they have been using for a long time! It is also critical that we acknowledge that the social and economic marginalization reflected in data is rooted in systemic oppression that upholds white supremacy and heteronormativity. We should all be reflecting about our own role in upholding these systems.

# Course website and communication

## Course website

All course related material can be found on the [course website](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass2/). Pre-recorded lecture videos, lecture notes (HTML), and .Rmd files will be posted on the class website under the associated sections. Additional resources (e.g., syllabus) may also be posted on the class website. 


## Course discussion

We will be using GitHub teams for class announcements [HERE](#).

  - __GitHub teams__: The teaching team will post all class announcements using GitHub teams. The GitHub team discussions feature allows for quick and seamless communication to all members of an organization or team -- in this case, to all students with a GitHub account enrolled in the course. Some features include:  
  
    1. The class team can be viewed and [`@mentioned`](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) by all students enrolled in the class and part of the organization.  
    2. Posts can include code snippets, links, images, and references to issues which make them ideal for this class discussion and participation.

*Credit: [Introducing team discussions](https://github.blog/2017-11-20-introducing-team-discussions/)*  

We will be using GitHub issues for questions and class discussion [HERE](#).

  - __GitHub issues__: GitHub issues are traditionally used by collaborators of a repository for managing tasks for a project. Our rational for using issues is twofold: 1) help track and organize questions related to course material and problem sets and 2) promote classroom participation. Students are encouraged to contribute to issues by posting questions, sharing helpful resources, and/or taking a stab at answering questions posted on issues. Some features include: 
    
    1. Adding labels  
    2. Assigning or mentioning users to an issue 
    3. Referencing other issues

# Assignments and grading

Course grade will be based on the following components:

-	Weekly problem sets (90 percent of total grade)
-	Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

## Problem sets (90 percent of total grade)

Students will complete 10 problem sets (the last one due during finals week). Problem sets are due by TBD, right before we start class. 

Late submissions will lose 20% (i.e., max grade becomes 80%). Problem sets not submitted by TBD will not receive points because at that point we will post solutions on the course website. The lowest problem-set grade will be dropped from the calculation of your final grade. 

Your will not lose points for late submission if you cannot submit a problem set due to an unexpected emergency. But please contact the instructor by email as soon as you can so we can work out a plan.

In general, each problem set will give you practice using the skills and concepts introduced during the previous lecture.  For example, after the lecture on ggplot, the problem set for that week will require that students complete several different tasks involving plotting data.  Additionally, the weekly problem sets will require you to use data visualization skills you learned in previous weeks.  

With the exception of the first problem set, students will complete problem sets in groups of 3. We will form groups during class in week 2 and you will keep the same group throughout the quarter. However, each student will submit their own assignment. You are encouraged to work together and get help from your group. However, it is important that you understand how to do the problem set on your own, rather than copying the solution developed by group members.  

Since you will be working together, it is understandable that answers for many questions will be the same as your group members. However, if I find compelling evidence that a student merely copied solutions from a classmate, I will consider this a violation of academic integrity and that student will receive a zero for the homework assignment.

A general strategy I recommend for completing the problem sets is as follows: (1) after lecture, do the reading associated with that lecture; (2) try doing the problem set on your own; (3) communicate with your group to work through the problem set, with a particular focus on areas group members find challenging.

Link to problem set expectations [HERE](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass2/assets/resources/ps_expectations.html).

## Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

Students are expected to participate in the weekly class meetings by being attentive, supportive, by asking questions, or by answering questions posed by others on Zoom. Additionally, students can receive strong participation grades by asking questions and answering questions on GitHub issues. 

Students are required to attend the weekly class meetings (unless you have talked to the instructors about this beforehand). Each unexcused absence results in a loss of 20% from your attendance/participation grade. Three or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course. 

An excused absence is a professional opportunity that you discuss with me beforehand or a medical, or family emergency.  Excused absences will not result in a loss of attendance points.  However, you will be responsible for all material covered in that class and you will be expected to turn in homework assignments on time.

## Grading scale

# Course policies

## Learning during a global pandemic

With the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we understand that right now is a challenging time for everybody. Many of us may be experiencing added stress or responsibilities that make learning and completing classwork difficult. If you are having trouble keeping up with the class, please reach out to the teaching team and we will help work out a plan with you. We understand that right now is a precarious time and in the event that you or someone in your family and/or shared living space gets sick, we ask that you please reach out to us as soon as you are able to. We want to be accommodating to everyone's unique situation and hope to make this class an enjoyable learning experience for all.

## Online collaboration/netiquette

You will communicate with instructors and peers virtually through a variety of tools such as GitHub, email, and Zoom web conferencing. The following guidelines will enable everyone in the course to participate and collaborate in a productive, safe environment.

-	Be professional, courteous, and respectful as you would in a physical classroom.
-	Online communication lacks the nonverbal cues that provide much of the meaning and nuances in face-to-face conversations. Choose your words carefully, phrase your sentences clearly, and stay on topic.
-	It is expected that students may disagree with the research presented or the opinions of their fellow classmates. To disagree is fine but to disparage others' views is unacceptable. All comments should be kept civil and thoughtful.
- It is imperative that we respect one another in this course, and all other spaces. One way to gain/show respect is to actively listen to one another. Please do not text, tweet, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, browse the internet, and such during class.
- In the unlikely event that Zoom is down, please be sure to check your email often for instructions on how we will complete that class session in an asynchronous manner.

**Class Zoom guidelines**  

All synchronous class sessions will be held online, via Zoom. Below, we have outlined some general guidelines about Zoom learning. As we continue learning together, we can add to and change the below list. I'm open to your feedback and your experiences as we continue to learn how to learn via Zoom.  

- **Video**: We will not require students to turn on their video during synchronous lectures. We encourage students to turn on their video only if they feel comfortable doing so -- particularly during small group breakout rooms.  
- **Audio**: We ask students to mute their microphones when they are not speaking. We encourage the use of earphones or headphones if you are in a space with background noise.  
- **Zoom outage**: In the unlikely event that Zoom is down, the instructors will email the class with instruction for completing the class section in an asynchronous manner. Therefore, if Zoom is not functioning properly during the class period, be sure to check your email often.  
- **Internet connectivity**: We understand that having access to a stable internet connection and/or electronic equipment is a privilege. With that in mind, we want to provide a space where everyone has the resources they need to do well in the class. If you have any issues with your internet connection and/or don't have access to electronic equipment, please reach out to the instructors.   

## Academic accomodations

**Center for Accessible Education**  

Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE). When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information visit https://www.cae.ucla.edu/.

Located in A255 Murphy Hall: (310) 825-1501, TDD (310) 206-6083; http://www.cae.ucla.edu/

-	Due to COVID-19, the CAE office is closed for in-person meetings
-	CAE counselor, resources, and services are still available via email / virtual appointment
-	Stay up-to-date with CAE newsletters & announcements at https://www.cae.ucla.edu/announcements-events/student

## Academic integrity

__UCLA policy__  

  - UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  
  
__This class__  

  - Given that 90% of course grade is based on problem sets, the primary academic honesty concern that could come up in this class is copying problem set solutions from somebody else and passing this in as your own work.


# Course schedule

Below is an overview of the tentative course schedule, which is subject to change at the discretion of the instructor. Topics may be cut if we need to devote more time to learning the most central topics. It is unlikely that additional topics will be added.
