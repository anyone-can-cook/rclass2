# Course description

EDUC 263: Fundamentals of Programming is the second course in "Anyone Can Cook," a data science sequence designed for students who never thought they would become "coders" or "programmers" (the first course in the sequence is [EDUC 263: Introduction to Programming and Data Management](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1/.)) Although EDUC 263 primarily uses the R programming language, the course is organized around practical programming skills/concepts that are fundamental across modern object-oriented programming languages (e.g., Python, Javascript). Course topics include the following: organizing files, folders, and scripts; reading (importing) and writing (exporting) data; using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration; writing functions; iteration (e.g., "loops"); conditional execution; strings and regular expressions. These general programming skills are prerequisite for flashier data science applications (e.g., web-scraping, streaming and analyzing social media data, interactive maps). Students will become proficient in programming skills/concepts through weekly problem sets, which will be completed in groups. Course format consists of weekly asynchronous lectures and weekly synchronous workshop-style class sessions on Zoom.

The course primarily use data and examples from education research. However, the course is designed to teach skills that are important for social science research more broadly and also for computational research within the humanities. __We welcome students from across the university__.

## Prerequisite Requirements 

The prerequisite is the first course in the sequence: [EDUC 263: Introduction to Programming and Data Management](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1/) or equivalent.

# Course learning goals

1. Organize files, directories, and programming scripts for a research project
1. Read data (e.g., .csv files) into R; Write data from R to other formats
1. Use Git and Github for version control and collaboration
    - Learn basic Unix commands ("Terminal" for Mac users; "Bash" for PC) necessary to perform Git operations from the command line
    - Perform essential actions in Git (clone repo, commit, push, merge)
    - Use GitHub to work collaboratively in teams
1. Become proficient in manipulating string/character data using string functions and regular expressions
    - Use string functions and regular expression (regex) patterns to parse text
    - Apply regular expressions to practical applications (e.g., analyzing Twitter data, web-scraping)
1. Learn programming concepts to write efficient code that completes multiple tasks
    - Iteration using loops
    - Conditional statements
    - Writing functions
    - Functional programming

Another broad goal of the course is for students to begin developing practical proficiency in "computational thinking." The [California Computer Science Standards](https://www.cde.ca.gov/be/st/ss/documents/compsciintroduction.docx) define computational thinking as "the human ability to formulate problems so that their solutions can be represented as computational steps or algorithms to be executed by a computer." This course will encourage students to work on the following elements of computational thinking:

- Continue practicing elements of computational thinking described in the syllabus of [EDUC 263: Introduction to Programming and Data Management](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass1/), the prerequisite to this course.
- For people who are new to programming, taking formal courses (like this one) and working through textbooks ([like this one](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) are great ways to learn programming skills and computational thinking. More advanced programmers often learn new skills by reading blog posts and tutorials on the web ([like this one](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)). Therefore, a goal of this course is for you to learn how to learn on your own. As such, a substantial portion of the required reading will be blog posts and online tutorials. Once you become proficient at learning from these resources, you can learn new programming skills on your own without always having to take a formal course.

## Course structure

<!-- For the first two or three weeks of the course, we will have synchronous lectures and class time will be on TBD. In the subsequent weeks, we will have asynchronous (pre-class) lectures and a synchronous workshop-style class that meets on TBD.  -->

The course will be structured around weekly asynchronous (pre-class) lectures and one synchronous workshop-style class meeting per week. Weekly homework will consist of students working through the lectures on their own, a modest amount of required reading, and weekly problem sets completed in groups of three.

1. __Asynchronous (pre-class) lecture materials__. Weekly asynchronous lecture materials will be posted on the course website with the expectation that students work through all lecture materials on their own. Lecture materials will consist of three types of resources: first, detailed lecture notes (HTML) with sample code; second, video lectures (45 to 60 minutes total per week) that discuss important and/or challenging concepts from the lecture, but not a line-by-line recitation of the lecture; and, third, the .Rmd file that created the HTML lecture notes. This .Rmd file will contain all "code chunks" and links to all data utilized in the lecture. Thus, students will be able to "learn by doing" in that they can run R code on their own computer while they work through lecture materials on their own.
1. __Synchronous class meetings.__ Our weekly synchronous meeting will by Fridays from 9:00 - 10:30AM. However, for Week 1 (and potentially for other selected weeks) weeks we will meet from 9:00 - 11:20AM. Synchronous meetings will largely be forward-looking (i.e., introducing new material) rather than backward-looking (e.g., reviewing/applying previously introduced material). The bulk of synchronous class time will be lecture about new course material. Lectures will not cover every concept and every slide. Rather, the goal of these lectures is for students to learn the most important and/or difficult concepts so that they have an easier time working through lecture materials on their own. These lectures will be recorded and added to the asynchronous lecture materials. We will also devote some time to Q&A about previous material and -- time permitting -- time for students to get started on the upcoming problem set.

## How to succeed in this class

In just a few words, the keys to success in this class are: __start early, ask for help, help others__

Here are some substantive tips to help you succeed:

- Work through weekly asynchronous lecture materials as soon as you can
  - The weekly asynchronous lecture materials (lecture HTML, lecture .Rmd file with code, short video lecture) are the core of this course. Lecture materials are designed for you to run the code on your computer as you work through the lecture. Therefore, treat each lecture as an active learning experience rather than passively reading lecture notes.
- Start the weekly problem set early so that have time to seek help on questions you are struggling with
- If you can't figure something out, ask for help!
  - Discuss with your problem set group
  - Ask a question on GitHub
  - Come to office hours
- Be supportive of your classmates. Together, we will create a classroom environment where we all help each other succeed!  

# Classroom environment

We all have a responsibility to ensure that every member of the class feels valued and safe. 
Be mindful that our words and body language affects others in ways we might not fully understand. We have a responsibility to express our ideas in a way that doesn't make disparaging generalizations and doesn't make people feel excluded. As an instructor, I am responsible for setting an example through my own conduct.

Learning the fundamentals of a new programming language can feel overwhelming! We must create an environment where students feel comfortable asking questions and talking about what they did not understand. Discomfort is part of the learning process. Unburden yourself from the weight of being an "expert." Focus your energy on improving and helping your classmates improve.

##  Towards an anti-racist, anti-heteronormative learning experience

This course teaches R programming and working with data, tools that are often perceived as objective, independent of context and content. We must acknowledge that racism, white supremacy, and heteronormative ideas of gender identity and sexual orientation are rooted in every aspect of data. These seemingly objective rules (e.g., "the right way to handle data") affect the way data are gathered, how variables are created, the questions asked (or not asked), etc. 

In this course we will utilize data that reflect systemic gaps based on race, ethnicity, immigration status, and gender identity, among other aspects of identity. It is critical to acknowledge that the processes used to create these data (e.g., how data collected, the categories chosen to represent identity) are often based on notions of white supremacy and heteronormativity. When you encounter a data management strategy that may cause harm, we encourage you to raise concerns. It may be that your instructor/TAs may need to think more critically about strategies they have been using for a long time! It is also critical that we acknowledge that the social and economic marginalization reflected in data is rooted in systemic oppression that upholds white supremacy and heteronormativity. We should all be reflecting about our own role in upholding these systems.

# Course website and communication

## Course website

All course related material can be found on the [course website](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass2/). Pre-recorded lecture videos, lecture notes (HTML), and .Rmd files will be posted on the class website under the associated sections. Additional resources (e.g., syllabus) may also be posted on the class website.

## Course discussion

We will be using GitHub teams for class announcements [HERE](https://github.com/orgs/anyone-can-cook/teams/rclass2_announcements).

  - __GitHub teams__: The teaching team will post all class announcements using GitHub teams. The GitHub team discussions feature allows for quick and seamless communication to all members of an organization or team -- in this case, to all students with a GitHub account enrolled in the course. Some features include:  
  
    1. The class team can be viewed and [`@mentioned`](https://docs.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-people-and-teams) by all students enrolled in the class and part of the organization.  
    2. Posts can include code snippets, links, images, and references to issues which make them ideal for this class discussion and participation.

*Credit: [Introducing team discussions](https://github.blog/2017-11-20-introducing-team-discussions/)*  

We will be using GitHub issues for questions and class discussion [HERE](https://github.com/anyone-can-cook/rclass2_student_issues).

  - __GitHub issues__: GitHub issues are traditionally used by collaborators of a repository for managing tasks for a project. Our rational for using issues is twofold: 1) help track and organize questions related to course material and problem sets and 2) promote classroom participation. Students are encouraged to contribute to issues by posting questions, sharing helpful resources, and/or taking a stab at answering questions posted on issues. Some features include: 
    
    1. Adding labels  
    2. Assigning or mentioning users to an issue 
    3. Referencing other issues

# Assignments and grading

Course grade will be based on the following components:

-	Weekly problem sets (90 percent of total grade)
-	Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

## Problem sets (90 percent of total grade)

Students will complete 10 problem sets (the last one due during finals week). Problem sets are due by 9:00am, right before we start class. 

Problem sets submitted a week after the problem set is due will not receive points because at that point we will post solutions on the course website. **Only** problem sets that are given an extension--with the approval of the teaching team-- will be accepted late. The lowest problem-set grade will be dropped from the calculation of your final grade. 

Your will not lose points for late submission if you cannot submit a problem set due to an unexpected emergency. But please contact the instructor by email as soon as you can so we can work out a plan.

In general, each problem set will give you practice using the skills and concepts introduced during the previous lecture.  For example, after the lecture on creating functions, the problem set for that week will require that students complete several different tasks involving creating their own function(s).  Additionally, the weekly problem sets will require you to use the programming skills you learned in previous weeks.  

With the exception of the first problem set, students will complete problem sets in groups of 3. We will form groups during class in week 1 and you will keep the same group throughout the quarter. However, each student will submit their own assignment. You are encouraged to work together and get help from your group. However, it is important that you understand how to do the problem set on your own, rather than copying the solution developed by group members.  

Since you will be working together, it is understandable that answers for many questions will be the same as your group members. However, if I find compelling evidence that a student merely copied solutions from a classmate, I will consider this a violation of academic integrity and that student will receive a zero for the homework assignment.

A general strategy I recommend for completing the problem sets is as follows: (1) after lecture, do the reading associated with that lecture; (2) try doing the problem set on your own; (3) communicate with your group to work through the problem set, with a particular focus on areas group members find challenging.

Link to problem set expectations [HERE](https://anyone-can-cook.github.io/rclass2/assets/resources/ps_expectations.html).

## Attendance and participation (10 percent of total grade)

Students are expected to participate in the weekly class meetings by being attentive, supportive, by asking questions, or by answering questions posed by others on Zoom. Additionally, students can receive strong participation grades by asking questions and answering questions on GitHub issues. 

Students are required to attend the weekly class meetings (unless you have talked to the instructors about this beforehand). Each unexcused absence results in a loss of 20% from your attendance/participation grade. Three or more unexcused absences will result in a failing grade for the course. 

An excused absence is a professional opportunity that you discuss with me beforehand or a medical, or family emergency.  Excused absences will not result in a loss of attendance points.  However, you will be responsible for all material covered in that class and you will be expected to turn in homework assignments on time.

# Course policies

## Learning during a global pandemic

With the ongoing spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, we understand that right now is a challenging time for everybody. Many of us may be experiencing added stress or responsibilities that make learning and completing classwork difficult. If you are having trouble keeping up with the class, please reach out to the teaching team and we will help work out a plan with you. We understand that right now is a precarious time and in the event that you or someone in your family and/or shared living space gets sick, we ask that you please reach out to us as soon as you are able to. We want to be accommodating to everyone's unique situation and hope to make this class an enjoyable learning experience for all.

## Online collaboration/netiquette

You will communicate with instructors and peers virtually through a variety of tools such as GitHub, email, and Zoom web conferencing. The following guidelines will enable everyone in the course to participate and collaborate in a productive, safe environment.

-	Be professional, courteous, and respectful as you would in a physical classroom.
-	Online communication lacks the nonverbal cues that provide much of the meaning and nuances in face-to-face conversations. Choose your words carefully, phrase your sentences clearly, and stay on topic.
-	It is expected that students may disagree with the research presented or the opinions of their fellow classmates. To disagree is fine but to disparage others' views is unacceptable. All comments should be kept civil and thoughtful.
- It is imperative that we respect one another in this course, and all other spaces. One way to gain/show respect is to actively listen to one another. Please do not text, tweet, email, Facebook, LinkedIn, browse the internet, and such during class.
- In the unlikely event that Zoom is down, please be sure to check your email often for instructions on how we will complete that class session in an asynchronous manner.

**Class Zoom guidelines**  

All synchronous class sessions will be held online, via Zoom. Below, we have outlined some general guidelines about Zoom learning. As we continue learning together, we can add to and change the below list. I'm open to your feedback and your experiences as we continue to learn how to learn via Zoom.  

- **Video**: We will not require students to turn on their video during synchronous lectures. We encourage students to turn on their video only if they feel comfortable doing so -- particularly during small group breakout rooms.  
- **Audio**: We ask students to mute their microphones when they are not speaking. We encourage the use of earphones or headphones if you are in a space with background noise.  
- **Zoom outage**: In the unlikely event that Zoom is down, the instructors will email the class with instruction for completing the class section in an asynchronous manner. Therefore, if Zoom is not functioning properly during the class period, be sure to check your email often.  
- **Internet connectivity**: We understand that having access to a stable internet connection and/or electronic equipment is a privilege. With that in mind, we want to provide a space where everyone has the resources they need to do well in the class. If you have any issues with your internet connection and/or don't have access to electronic equipment, please reach out to the instructors.   

## Academic accomodations

**Center for Accessible Education**  

Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE). When possible, students should contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term as reasonable notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. For more information visit https://www.cae.ucla.edu/.

Located in A255 Murphy Hall: (310) 825-1501, TDD (310) 206-6083; http://www.cae.ucla.edu/

-	Due to COVID-19, the CAE office is closed for in-person meetings
-	CAE counselor, resources, and services are still available via email / virtual appointment
-	Stay up-to-date with CAE newsletters & announcements at https://www.cae.ucla.edu/announcements-events/student

## Academic integrity

__UCLA policy__  

  - UCLA is a community of scholars. In this community, all members including faculty, staff and students alike are responsible for maintaining standards of academic honesty. As a student and member of the University community, you are here to get an education and are, therefore, expected to demonstrate integrity in your academic endeavors. You are evaluated on your own merits. Cheating, plagiarism, collaborative work, multiple submissions without the permission of the professor, or other kinds of academic dishonesty are considered unacceptable behavior and will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  
  
__This class__  

  - Given that 90% of course grade is based on problem sets, the primary academic honesty concern that could come up in this class is copying problem set solutions from somebody else and passing this in as your own work.

# Campus resources
