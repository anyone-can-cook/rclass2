## Datasets we will use

We will use two datasets that are part of the `ggplot2` package:

- `mpg`: EPA fuel economy data in 1999 and 2008 for 38 car models that had a new release every year between 1999 and 2008
    - Note: There are no set of variables that uniquely identify observations
- `diamonds`: Prices and attributes of about 54,000 diamonds

```{r}
#?mpg
glimpse(mpg)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Uniquely identify obs?
#mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer,model,cyl,trans,drv,fl,year) %>% count()
#mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer,model,cyl,trans,drv,fl,year,displ,cty,hwy,class) %>% count()
```

```{r}
#?diamonds
glimpse(diamonds)
```

We will use public-use data from the _National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Educational Longitudinal Survey (ELS)_ of 2002:

- Follows 10th graders from 2002 until 2012
- Variable `stu_id` uniquely identifies observations
```{r}

# variables we want to select from full ELS dataset
els_keepvars <- c(
    "STU_ID",        # student id
    "STRAT_ID",      # stratum id
    "PSU",           # primary sampling unit
    "BYRACE",        # (base year) race/ethnicity 
    "BYINCOME",      # (base year) parental income
    "BYPARED",       # (base year) parental education
    "BYNELS2M",      # (base year) math score
    "BYNELS2R",      # (base year) reading score
    "F3ATTAINMENT",  # (3rd follow up) attainment
    "F2PS1SEC",      # (2nd follow up) first institution attended
    "F3ERN2011",     # (3rd follow up) earnings from employment in 2011
    "F1SEX",         # (1st follow up) sex composite
    "F2EVRATT",      # (2nd follow up, composite) ever attended college
    "F2PS1LVL",      # (2nd follow up, composite) first attended postsecondary institution, level 
    "F2PS1CTR",      # (2nd follow up, composite) first attended postsecondary institution, control
    "F2PS1SLC"       # (2nd follow up, composite) first attended postsecondary institution, selectivity
)
els_keepvars

load(url("https://github.com/anyone-can-cook/rclass2/raw/master/data/els/els.RData"))

els <- els %>%
  # keep only subset of vars
  select(one_of(els_keepvars)) %>%
  # lower variable names
  rename_all(tolower)

```

# Concepts

Basic definitions:

- Grammar
    - "The fundamental principles or rules of an art or science" (Oxford English dictonary)
- Grammar of graphics [@RN4563]
    - Principles/rules to describe and construct statistical graphics
- Layered grammar of graphics [@RN4561]
    - Principles/rules to describe and construct statistical graphics "based around the idea of building up a graphic from multiple layers of data" [@RN4561, p. 4]
    - The layered grammar of graphics is a "formal system for building plots... based on the insight that you can uniquely describe _any_ plot as a combination of" seven paramaters [@RN4564, chapter 3] 
- Aesthetics
    - __Aesthetics__ are visual elements of the plot (e.g., lines, points, symbols, colors, axes)
    - __Aesthetic mappings__ are visual elements of the plot determined by values of specific variables (e.g., a scatterplot where the color of each point depends on the value of the variable `race`)
    - However, aesthetics need not be determined by variable values. For example, when creating a scatterplot you may specify that the color of each point be blue.

The seven parameters of the layered grammar of graphics consists of:

- Five layers
    - A dataset (__data__)
    - A set of aesthetic mappings (__mappings__)
    - A statistical transformation (__stat__)
    - A geometric object (__geom__)        
    - A position adjustment (__position__)
- A coordinate system (__coord__)
- A faceting scheme (__facets__)

`ggplot2` -- part of `tidyverse` -- is an R package to create graphics and `ggplot()` is a function within the `ggplot2` package. 

> "In practice, you rarely need to supply all seven parameters to make a graph because ggplot2 will provide useful defaults for everything except the data, the mappings, and the geom function." [@RN4564, chapter 3]

Syntax conveying the seven parameters of the layered grammer of graphics:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(
     stat = <STAT>, 
     position = <POSITION>
  ) +
  <COORDINATE_FUNCTION> +
  <FACET_FUNCTION>
```

## Layers

What does Wickham mean by __layers__? (from "[Telling Stories with Data Using the Grammar of Graphics](https://codewords.recurse.com/issues/six/telling-stories-with-data-using-the-grammar-of-graphics)" by Liz Sander)

- In the grammar of a language, words have different parts of speach (e.g., noun, verb, adjective), with each part of speech performing a different role in a sentence
- The layered grammar of graphics decomposes a graphic into different __layers__
    - "These are layers in a literal sense â€“ you can think of them as transparency sheets for an overhead projector, each containing a piece of the graphic, which can be arranged and combined in a variety of ways."


The five layers of the grammar of graphics:

- [Dataset](#dataset-data) (__data__)
- [Set of mappings](#set-of-mappings-mappings) (__mappings__)
- [Statistical transformation](#statistical-transformation-stat) (__stat__)
- [Geometric object](#geometric-objects-geoms) (__geom__)
- [Position adjustment](#position-adjustment-position) (__position__)


### Dataset (__data__)

**Data** defines the information to be visualized.

**Example**: Imagine a dataset where each observation is a student

- The variables of interest are high school math test score (`bynels2m`), earnings in 2011 (`f3ern2011`), and student sex (`f1sex`)

```{r}
glimpse(els)
els %>% select(stu_id,bynels2m,f3ern2011,f1sex) %>% as_factor() %>% head(10)
```

<!--
PROBABLY CUT THIS HYPOTHETICAL DATASET
```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
incage <- tribble(
  ~id, ~age, ~inc000,
  1, 30, 70,
  2, 20, 18,
  3, 25, 150,
  4, 50, 200,
  5, 65, 15
)
incage
```
-->

### Set of mappings (__mappings__)

**Mapping** defines how variables in a dataset are applied (mapped) to a graphic.

**Example**: Consider the previous dataset

- Map HS math test score to the x-axis
- Map 2011 income to the y-axis
- Additionally, if we are creating a scatterplot of test score (x-axis) and income (y-axis), we might use sex to define the color of each point

```{r}

els %>% select(stu_id,bynels2m,f3ern2011,f1sex) %>% 
  rename(x=bynels2m, y=f3ern2011, color=f1sex) %>% 
  as_factor() %>% head(10)

```


### Statistical transformation (__stat__)

A **statistical transformation** transforms the underlying data before plotting it.

**Example**: Imagine creating a scatterplot of the relationship between HS math test score (x-axis) and 2011 income (y-axis)

- When creating a scatterplot we usually do not transform the data prior to plotting
- This is the "identity" transformation
    
```{r}
els %>% select(stu_id,bynels2m,f3ern2011) %>% rename(x=bynels2m, y=f3ern2011) %>% 
  as_factor() %>% head(10)

```
    
**Example**: Imagine creating a bar chart of the number of students by race/ethnicity

- Here, we do not plot the raw data. Rather, we count the number of observations for each race/ethnicity category. 
- This count is a statistical transformation

```{r}
els %>% count(byrace) %>% as_factor()
```


### Geometric objects (__geoms__)

Graphs visually display data, using **geometric objects** like a point, line, bar, etc.

- Each geometric object in a graph is called a "geom"
- "A geom is the geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data" [@RN4564, chapter 3]
- "People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses. For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms, boxplots use boxplot geoms"  [@RN4564, chapter 3]
- __Aesthetics__ are "visual attributes of the geom" (e.g., color, fill, shape, position) ([Grammar of Graphics](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/grammar-of-graphics/))
    - Each geom can only display certain aesthetics
    - For example, a "point geom" can only include the aesthetics position, color, shape, and size 
- We can plot the same underlying data using different geoms (e.g., bar chart vs. pie chart)
- A single graph can layer multiple geoms (e.g., scatterplot with a "line of best fit" layered on top)

### Position adjustment (__position__)

**Position adjustment** adjusts the position of visual elements in the plot so that these visual elements do not overlap with one another in ways that make the plot difficult to interpret.

**Example**: The dataset `mpg` (included in the `ggplot2` package) contains variables for the specifications of different cars, with 234 observations

- Create a scatterplot of the relationship between number of cylinders in the engine (x-axis) and highway miles-per-gallon (y-axis)
- Below plot is difficult to interpet because many points overlap with one another

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

- The `jitter` position adjustment "adds a small amount of random variation to the location of each point" (from `?geom_jitter`)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(position = "jitter")
```


## Coordinate system (__coord__)

"A **coordinate system** maps the position of objects onto the plane of the plot, and controls how the axes and grid lines are drawn. Plots typically use two coordinates (x,y), but could use any number of coordinates." ([Grammar of Graphics](https://cfss.uchicago.edu/notes/grammar-of-graphics/))

**Example**: Cartesian coordinate system

- Most plots use the Cartesian coordinate system

```{r}
x1 <- c(1, 10)
y1 <- c(1, 5)
p <- qplot(x = x1, y = y1, geom = "blank", xlab = NULL, ylab = NULL) +
  theme_bw()

p +
  ggtitle(label = "Cartesian coordinate system")

```

- When using the default Cartesian coordinate system, a common task is to flip the x and y axis. (From [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#coordinate-systems))

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

**Example**: Polar coordinate system

```{r}
p +
  coord_polar() +
  ggtitle(label = "Polar coordinate system")
```


## Faceting scheme (__facets__)

__Facets__ are subplots that display one subset of the data. They are most commonly used to create "small multiples"

**Example**: Imagine creating a scatterplot of the relationship between number of cylinders in the engine (x-axis) and highway miles-per-gallon (y-axis), with separate subplots for car `class` (e.g., midsize, minivan, pickup, suv)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy), position = "jitter") + 
  facet_wrap(~ class, nrow = 2)
```



# Creating graphs using `ggplot`

## `ggplot()` and `aes()` functions

Show help pages for package `ggplot2`:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(package = ggplot2)
```

__The `ggplot()` function__:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?ggplot

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
ggplot(data = NULL, mapping = aes())
```

- Description (from help file)
    - "`ggplot()` initializes a ggplot object. It can be used to declare the input data frame for a graphic and to specify the set of plot aesthetics intended to be common throughout all subsequent layers unless specifically overridden"
- Arguments
    - `data`: Dataset to use for plot.  If not specified in `ggplot()` function, must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.
    - `mapping`: Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for plot. If not specified, must be supplied in each layer added to the plot.
 
    
__The `aes()` function__ (often called within the `ggplot()` function): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?aes

# SYNTAX
aes(x, y, ...)
``` 

- Description (from help file)
    - "Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties (aesthetics) of geoms. Aesthetic mappings can be set in `ggplot()` and in individual layers."
- Arguments
    - `x, y, ...`: List of name value pairs giving aesthetics to map to variables
      - The names for `x` and `y` aesthetics are typically omitted because they are so common
      - All other aesthetics must be named
    
**Example**: Putting `ggplot()` and `aes()` together

- Specifying `ggplot()` and `aes()` without specifying a geom layer (e.g., `geom_point()`) creates a blank ggplot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

- Alternatively, we can use pipes with the dataframe we want to plot, which allows us to omit the first `data` argument of `ggplot()`:

```{r}
class(diamonds)
diamonds %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

- We can also create a ggplot object and assign it to a variable for later use:

```{r}
diam_ggplot <- ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price))

diam_ggplot # blank ggplot
```

- Investigate ggplot object:

```{r}
typeof(diam_ggplot)
class(diam_ggplot)

str(diam_ggplot)
```

- Attributes of ggplot object:

```{r}
attributes(diam_ggplot)

diam_ggplot$mapping

diam_ggplot$labels
```


## Adding geometric layers

Adding a **geometric layer** to a ggplot object dictates how observations are displayed in the plot.

- Geometric layers are specified using "geom functions"
- There are many different geom functions:
    - `geom_point()`: creates a scatterplot
    - `geom_bar()`: creates a bar chart
    - etc.

### Scatterplots using `geom_point()`

**Scatterplots** are most useful for showing the relationship between two continuous variables.

**Example**: Scatterplot of the relationship between `carat` and `price`, using the `diamonds` dataset

```{r}
#ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) + geom_point()
```

- If we already created and assigned a ggplot object, we can use that object to create the plot:

```{r}
diam_ggplot + geom_point()
```


**Example**: Scatterplot of the relationship between high school math test score (`bynels2m`) and 2011 earnings (`f3ern2011`), using the `els` dataset


- First, let's investigate the underlying variables:

```{r}
els %>% select(bynels2m,f3ern2011) %>%
  summarize_all(.funs = list(~ mean(., na.rm = TRUE), ~ min(., na.rm = TRUE), ~ max(., na.rm = TRUE)))
```

- Investigate values less than zero:

```{r}
els %>% select(bynels2m) %>% filter(bynels2m<0) %>% count(bynels2m)
els %>% select(bynels2m) %>% filter(bynels2m<0) %>% count(bynels2m) %>% as_factor()

els %>% select(f3ern2011) %>% filter(f3ern2011<0) %>% count(f3ern2011)
els %>% select(f3ern2011) %>% filter(f3ern2011<0) %>% count(f3ern2011) %>% as_factor()
```

- Create version of variables that replace values less than zero with `NA`:


```{r}
els_v2 <- els %>% 
  mutate(
    hs_math = if_else(bynels2m<0,NA_real_,as.numeric(bynels2m)),
    earn2011 = if_else(f3ern2011<0,NA_real_,as.numeric(f3ern2011)),
  )

#check
els_v2 %>% filter(bynels2m<0) %>% count(bynels2m, hs_math)
els_v2 %>% filter(f3ern2011<0) %>% count(f3ern2011, earn2011)

els_v2 %>% count(bypared) %>% as_factor()
```

- To avoid scatterplot with too many points, create a dataframe consisting of students whose parents have a PhD or first professional degree:

```{r}
els_parphd <- els_v2 %>% filter(bypared==8)
```

- Plot the scatterplot:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data= els_parphd, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + geom_point()
```

<br>

__The `geom_point()` function__:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?geom_point

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
geom_point(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
           position = "identity", ..., na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
           inherit.aes = TRUE)
```

- Aesthetics: `geom_point()` understands (i.e., accepts) the following aesthetics (required aesthetics in **bold**)
    - **`x`**, **`y`**, `alpha`, `colour`, `fill`, `group`, `shape`, `size`, `stroke`
    - Note: Other geom functions (e.g., `geom_bar()`) accepts a different set of aesthetics

<br>

**Example**: Scatterplot of the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway miles-per-gallon (`hwy`), using the `mpg` dataset

- Color of points determined by type of car (`class`):

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()
```

- Alternatively, the `color` aesthetic can be specified within `geom_point()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class))
```
  

**Student Task**: Using the `els_parphd` dataset, create a scatterplot of the relationship between HS math score (`hs_math`) on the x-axis and 2011 earnings (`earn2011`) on the y-axis, with the color of points determined by sex (`f1sex`)

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

- Below code doesn't work because `aes()` expects the `color` aesthetic to be a factor variable:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data= els_parphd, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, color = f1sex)) + geom_point()
```

- This works:
```{r, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data= els_parphd, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, color = as_factor(f1sex))) + geom_point()
```
</details>
<br>

### Smoothed prediction lines using `geom_smooth()`

Why use `geom_smooth()`?

- The biggest problem with scatterplots is "overplotting." That is, when you plot many observations, points may be plotted on top of one another and it becomes difficult to visually discern the relationship:

```{r}
ggplot(data = els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + geom_point()
```

- Instead, using `geom_smooth()` creates smoothed prediction lines with shaded confidence intervals:

```{r}
ggplot(data = els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + geom_smooth()
```

<br>

__The `geom_smooth()` function__:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?geom_smooth

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
geom_smooth(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "smooth",
            position = "identity", ..., method = "auto", formula = y ~ x,
            se = TRUE, na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
```

- Arguments
    - Note default "statistical transformation" (`stat`), as compared to that of `geom_point()`:
        - `stat = "smooth"` for `geom_smooth()`
        - `stat = "identity"` for `geom_point()`
- Aesthetics: `geom_smooth()` accepts the following aesthetics (required aesthetics in **bold**)
    - **`x`**, **`y`**, `alpha`, `colour`, `fill`, `group`, `linetype`, `size`, `weight`, `ymax`, `ymin`
    
<br>

**Example**: Smoothed prediction lines for high school math test score (`bynels2m`) versus 2011 earnings (`f3ern2011`), using the `els` dataset

- This code produces same plot as above, when aesthetics were specified in `ggplot()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data=els_v2) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011))
```

- Use `group` aesthetic to create separate prediction lines by sex (`f1sex`):

```{r}
#ggplot(data=els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, group=as_factor(f1sex))) + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data=els_v2) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, group=as_factor(f1sex)))
```

- Use `linetype` aesthetic to create separate prediction lines (with different line styles) by sex (`f1sex`):

```{r}
#ggplot(data=els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, linetype=as_factor(f1sex))) + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data=els_v2) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, linetype=as_factor(f1sex)))
```

- Use `color` aesthetic to create separate prediction lines (with different colors) by sex (`f1sex`):

```{r}
#ggplot(data=els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, color=as_factor(f1sex))) + geom_smooth()
ggplot(data=els_v2) + geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, color=as_factor(f1sex)))
```


### Plotting multiple geom layers

**Example**: Layer smoothed prediction lines (`geom_smooth()`) on top of scatterplot (`geom_point()`)

```{r}
ggplot(data= els_v2) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011))
```

- Equivalently, the same plot can be created using this syntax:

```{r}
ggplot(data= els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

- Adjust x-axis and y-axis limits by using `+ xlim()` and `+ ylim()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data= els_v2, aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  xlim(c(20,80)) + ylim(c(0,100000))
```

- Layer smoothed prediction lines with different line types by sex (`f1sex`) on top of scatterplot with different point colors by sex:

```{r}
ggplot(data= els_v2) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, color = as_factor(f1sex))) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = hs_math, y = earn2011, linetype = as_factor(f1sex))) +
  xlim(c(20,80)) + ylim(c(0,100000))
```


### Bar charts using `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()`

**Bar charts** are used to plot a single, discrete variable.

- X-axis typically represents a categorical variable (e.g,. race, sex, institutional type)
    - Each value of the categorical variable is a "group"
- Y-axis often represents the number of cases in a group (or the proportion of cases in a group)
    - But height of bar could also represent mean value for a group or some other summary statistic (e.g., min, max, std)


Two geom functions to create bar charts:

- `geom_bar()`: The height of each bar represents the number of cases (i.e., observations) in the group
    - Statistical transformation = "count"
        - Y-value for a group is the number of cases in the group
    - Use `geom_bar()` when using (for example) student-level data and you don't want to summarize student-level data prior to creating the chart
- `geom_col()`: The height of each bar represents the value of some variable for the group
    - Statistical transformation = "identity"
        - Y-value for a group is the value of a variable in the dataframe
    - Use `geom_col()` when you have already created an object of summary statistics (e.g., counts, mean value, etc.)
    
<br>

__The `geom_bar()` and `geom_col()` functions__:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?geom_bar

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
geom_bar(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "count",
         position = "stack", ..., width = NULL, binwidth = NULL,
         na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)


?geom_col

**Example**: Bar chart with the variable `cut` (e.g., "Fair," "Good," "Ideal") as x-axis and number of diamonds as y-axis, using the `diamonds` dataset

- Essentially, you are being asked to create a bar chart from the following frequency count:

```{r}
diamonds %>% count(cut)
```

***Method 1***: Create bar chart using `geom_bar()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut)) +
  geom_bar()
```

***Method 2***: Create bar chart using `geom_col()`

- First, create an object of frequency count for the variable `cut`:

```{r}
cut_count <- diamonds %>% count(cut)
cut_count
```

- Next, use `ggplot() + geom_col` to plot the data from the object `cut_count`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = cut_count, aes(x = cut, y=n)) +
  geom_col()
```

- Alternatively, we can use pipes to create the plot without creating a separate `cut_count` object first:

```{r}
#diamonds %>% count(cut) %>% str()
diamonds %>% count(cut) %>% str()
diamonds %>% count(cut) %>% ggplot(aes(x= cut, y=n)) + 
  geom_col()
```


**Student Task**: Using the `els_v2` dataset, create a bar chart with the variable "ever attended postsecondary education" (`f2evratt`) as x-axis and number of students as y-axis

<details><summary>Solution</summary>

- Essentially, you are being asked to create a bar chart from the following frequency count:

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#glimpse(els_v2)
els_v2 %>% select(f2evratt) %>% var_label()

#ever attended
els_v2 %>% count(f2evratt)
```

```{r}
els_v2 %>% count(f2evratt) %>% as_factor()
```

***Method 1***: Create bar chart using `geom_bar()`

```{r}
ggplot(data = els_v2, aes(x = as_factor(f2evratt))) +
  geom_bar()
```

- Additionally, we can use pipes to filter values of `f2evratt` before plotting:

```{r}
els_v2 %>% filter(f2evratt>=0) %>% ggplot(aes(x = as_factor(f2evratt))) +
  geom_bar()
```

***Method 2***: Create bar chart using `geom_col()`

```{r}
els_v2 %>% 
  # filter to remove missing values
  filter(f2evratt>=0) %>% 
  # use count() to create summary statistics object
  count(f2evratt) %>%
  # plot summary statistic object
  ggplot(aes(x=as_factor(f2evratt), y=n)) + geom_col()
```

</details>

<!-- Relationship between discrete x and discrete y -->

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
els_v2 %>% select(f2evratt,f2ps1lvl) %>% var_label()

#ever attended
els_v2 %>%  count(f2evratt)
els_v2 %>%  count(f2evratt) %>% as_factor()

#level of first postsec institution
els_v2 %>%  count(f2ps1lvl)
els_v2 %>%  count(f2ps1lvl) %>% as_factor()

#ever attended by level attended
els_v2 %>%  count(f2evratt,f2ps1lvl)
els_v2 %>%  count(f2evratt,f2ps1lvl) %>% as_factor()

```

## Small multiples using faceting

**Facets** divide a plot into subplots based on the values of one or more discrete variables. They are most commonly used to create "small multiples"

Two functions to split your plots into facets:

- `facet_grid()`: Display subplots in grid format, where rows and columns are determined by the faceting variable(s)
    - `facet_grid()` is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data
- `facet_wrap()`: Display all subplots side-by-side, but can be wrapped to fill multiple rows
    - `facet_wrap()` generally has better use of screen space, and you can specify the number of plots in each row or column

<br>

__The `facet_grid()` and `facet_wrap()` functions__:
    
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?facet_grid

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
facet_grid(rows = NULL, cols = NULL, scales = "fixed",
  space = "fixed", shrink = TRUE, labeller = "label_value",
  as.table = TRUE, switch = NULL, drop = TRUE, margins = FALSE,
  facets = NULL)

?facet_wrap

# SYNTAX AND DEFAULT VALUES
facet_wrap(facets, nrow = NULL, ncol = NULL, scales = "fixed",
  shrink = TRUE, labeller = "label_value", as.table = TRUE,
  switch = NULL, drop = TRUE, dir = "h", strip.position = "top")
```

Specifying which variable(s) to facet your plot on:

- `facet_grid()`
  - Since `facet_grid()` arranges subplots in a grid format, we need to specify how we define the rows and columns
  - One way to do this is passing in the `rows` and `cols` arguments, which should be variables quoted by `vars()`
    - `facet_grid(rows = vars(<var_1>), cols = vars(<var_2>))`: facet into both rows and columns
    - `facet_grid(rows = vars(<var_1>))`: facet into rows only
    - `facet_grid(cols = vars(<var_1>))`: facet into columns only
  - Alternatively, we can pass in a _formula_, which has the syntax `<row_var> ~ <col_var>`
    - `facet_grid(<var_1> ~ <var_2>)`: facet into both rows and columns
    - `facet_grid(<var_1> ~ .)`: facet into rows only
    - `facet_grid(. ~ <var_1>)`: facet into columns only
- `facet_wrap()`
  - `facet_wrap()` also accepts a _formula_ for its `facets` argument
    - `facet_wrap(~ <var_1>)`: facet by one variable
    - `facet_wrap(<var_1> ~ <var_2>)`: facet on the combination of two variables

### Faceting by one variable

**Example**: Scatterplot of the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway miles-per-gallon (`hwy`), faceted by number of cylinders (`cyl`), from the `mpg` dataset

***Method 1***: Faceting using `facet_grid()`

- For one variable, you can choose to facet into rows or columns:

```{r}
# Facet into rows
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(cyl))
```

```{r}
# Facet into columns
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(cyl))
```

- Alternatively, we could specify the input as a _formula_ to get the same results:

```{r}
# Facet into rows
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cyl ~ .)
```

```{r}
# Facet into columns
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ cyl)
```

***Method 2***: Faceting using `facet_wrap()`

- Unlike `facet_grid()`, `facet_wrap()` is not restricted to either rows or columns:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl)
```

- But we are free to set the number of rows or columns if we wanted:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl, nrow = 1)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ cyl, ncol = 1)
```

### Faceting by two variables

**Example**: Scatterplot of the relationship between engine displacement (`displ`) and highway miles-per-gallon (`hwy`), faceted by number of cylinders (`cyl`) and type of car (`class`), from the `mpg` dataset

***Method 1***: Faceting using `facet_grid()`

- For example, we can make the rows based on `cyl` and the columns based on `class`:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(cyl), cols = vars(class))
```

- Alternatively, we could specify the input as a _formula_ to get the same results:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cyl ~ class)
```

***Method 2***: Faceting using `facet_wrap()`

- Since `facet_wrap()` is not defined by rows and columns, it omits any subplots that do not display any data:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(cyl ~ class)
```

- We are also free to choose the number of rows or columns to display:

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(cyl ~ class, nrow = 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(cyl ~ class, ncol = 4)
```

# Exporting plots

The plots generated by `ggplot` can be exported as a PDF, PNG, or other file types. (From [Creating and Saving Graphs - R Base Graphs](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/creating-and-saving-graphs-r-base-graphs))

## Exporting in RStudio

In RStudio, the generated plots will typically be displayed in the lower right panel. There is an `Export` button that allows you to save the plot as a PDF or PNG:

[![](http://www.sthda.com/sthda/RDoc/images/create-save-plots-r.png)](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/creating-and-saving-graphs-r-base-graphs)

## Exporting via R code

There are also various R functions, including `jpeg()`, `png()`, `svg()`, and `pdf()`, for exporting plots.

The steps for saving a plot:

- Use one of the R functions to open a file
  - Optional arguments include `height` and `width` for specifying image dimension
- Create the plot
- Close the file with `dev.off()`

**Example**: Exporting plot using `pdf()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Open the file
pdf('Rplot.pdf')

# Create the plot
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()

# Close the file
dev.off()
```

**Example**: Exporting plot using `jpeg()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Open the file
jpeg('Rplot.jpg', width = 350, height = 350)

# Create the plot
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class)) + 
  geom_point()

# Close the file
dev.off()
```
