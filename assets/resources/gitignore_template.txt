#
# The .gitignore file specifies which files in a git repo to intentionally ignore, or not track.
#
# Common pattern format rules:
# - Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments
# - Lines starting with `!` means do not ignore this pattern
#   - E.g., `!important.txt` means do not ignore the `important.txt` file
# - `*` matches anything except `/`
#   - E.g., `file.*` matches `file.csv` and `file.png`
# - `?` matches any one character except `/`
#   - E.g., `file?.csv` matches `file1.csv`, `fileA.csv`, and `file_.csv`
# - `[]` can be used to match specific characters or range of characters
#   - E.g., `file[1A].csv` matches `file1.csv` and `fileA.csv`
#   - E.g., `file[A-Z0-9].csv` matches `file2.csv` and `fileB.csv` but not `file_.csv`
# - If there is a `/` at the start or middle of the pattern, it only matches within the directory that .gitignore is located (and not within subdirectories), unless `**/` is added at the very beginning
#   - E.g., `/doc` or `doc/foo` matches these folders at the directory where .gitignore is located
#   - E.g., `**/doc`` or `**/doc/foo` matches these folders within subdirectories as well

# For example, if we want to ignore all files in the input_data/ directory:
# input_data/

# Or if we want to specifically ignore CSV files inside intput_data/ directory:
# input_data/*.csv
