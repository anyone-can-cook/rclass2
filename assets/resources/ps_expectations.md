# Problem Set Expectations

- Each team will create one repository to share
  - Rotate who will be creating the repository each week
  - Make sure to include a `.gitignore` file in the repository
    - You can add a `.gitignore` file (select `R` template) when creating the repository on GitHub
- Make sure to create an RStudio project to work on the problem set
  - All file paths must be relative to this project directory
- All work should be done on a separate branch other than master
  - To have your branch merged into master, you must push it to the remote and open a pull request
  - Each group member must open at least one pull request per problem set
- All your work will be completed in an R script (rather than an Rmd file)
  - Use R script template found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rucla-ed/rclass2/master/_resources/problemset/ps_template.R)
  - Make sure your R script runs without errors before submitting
